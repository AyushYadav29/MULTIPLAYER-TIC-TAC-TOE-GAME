# Multiplayer-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game in
which a Server creates the game in Local Area
Network.The players in LAN can connect to the server
using the IP address of the server provided. A 30
second timer is also added for every turn of the
player, if any player exceeds time then the 2 nd player
wins.
We have assigned “X” to the server and “O” to the
client. Whenever a person wins the game we display
an end screen showing the result. After the game has
ended you can also reset the game by pressing
SPACEBAR on both sides. If the timer reaches 0 the
game ends for that side there only.

# Project requirements:
Python 3.7
Pygame module(install using:- pip install pygame)
Pygame module mixer present in pygame only.
os module(already present in python)

# Any project related information
You can play it for as many times as you wish but when the timer reaches
0 the program will end.
To reload the game press Spacebar.
We are using Pycharm to execute our code.
We used adobe Illustrator to make “X” and “O” images.
We have also added a game sound which is upbeat in nature.
